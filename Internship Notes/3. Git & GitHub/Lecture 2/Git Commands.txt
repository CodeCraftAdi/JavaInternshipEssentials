Git & GitHub - Version Control System (VCS)

Git Commands:

1. Connecting to a Remote Repository:
   git remote add origin <RepositoryUrl>  
   - Links the local repository to a remote GitHub repository.
   - Allows pushing and pulling changes from the remote.

2. Renaming the Default Branch:
   git branch -M main  
   - Renames the current branch to "main".
   - Ensures compatibility with modern Git conventions.

3. Pushing Local Changes to Remote:
   git push -u origin main  
   - Pushes the local "main" branch to the remote repository.
   - The "-u" flag sets the upstream branch for future pushes/pulls.

4. Cloning a Repository:
   git clone <RepositoryUrl>  
   - Downloads a copy of a remote repository to the local system.
   - Preserves the full commit history.

5. Pulling Latest Changes from Remote:
   git pull  
   - Fetches and merges the latest changes from the remote repository.
   - Keeps the local repository up-to-date.

6. Fetching Remote Updates Without Merging:
   git fetch  
   - Retrieves the latest changes from the remote but does not merge them.
   - Allows reviewing updates before merging.

7. Comparing Local & Remote Branches:
   git diff HEAD origin/main  
   - Shows differences between the local "HEAD" and the remote "main" branch.
   - Useful to check what changes exist in the remote before pulling.
