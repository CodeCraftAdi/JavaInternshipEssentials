=> String :-
	-> String is the group / collection / sequence of characters, for example :-
		String name = "deepak";
	-> String is an array of characters, for example :-
		char[] c = {'d','e','e','p','a','k'};

	-> To create String, java has provided some classes i.e.
		= java.lang.String
		= java.lang.StringBuffer
		= java.lang.StringBuilder
		= java.util.StringTokenizer

	-> String is non-primitive data type

	-> String is a pre-defined class which is present in "java.lang" package
	-> Syntax :-
		public final class String extends Object implements Serializable, Comparable, CharSequence
		{
			//Constructors

			//Methods
		}

	-> String is the class and we can create String class object. But we can create String object by 2 ways :-
		1. String str = new String("deepak");
		2. String str = "deepak";

	-> Whenever we create String class object, object created is always "IMMUTABLE" (which cannot be changed)

	-> String objects allocates the memory in "String Constant Pool (SCP)" or "String Literal Pool (SLP)", which is present in Heap Area.
	
	-> Garbage collection is not application for String Constant Pool
